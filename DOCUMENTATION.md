## üè† **Overview Tab**

### Purpose
The main dashboard providing a bird's-eye view of market assets and user portfolio summary.

### Key Components
- **Market Overview**: Live asset list with real-time price updates
- **Portfolio Summary**: Quick stats on positions and available balance
- **Real-time WebSocket Integration**: Live price streaming for immediate updates

### Design Decisions
- **Layout**: Two-column grid (xl:grid-cols-2) for optimal desktop/mobile experience
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented for asset lists to handle 200+ assets without performance degradation
- **Live Price Components**: Custom DOM manipulation components (`LivePriceValue`) to avoid React re-renders on frequent price updates

### Trade-offs
- **Performance vs Features**: Chose virtual scrolling over infinite scroll for better memory management
- **Real-time vs Battery**: WebSocket connections provide instant updates but consume more battery on mobile
- **Complexity vs UX**: Live price components require more complex state management but provide superior user experience

### Reflection
The Overview tab serves as the platform's entry point, balancing information density with usability. The virtual scrolling implementation was crucial for handling large asset datasets while maintaining 60fps performance.

- **Real-time Calculations**: Live price updates in forms increase complexity but improve accuracy
- **Mobile Layout**: Stacked layout on mobile sacrifices some efficiency for usability

### Reflection
The trading interface prioritizes ease of use over advanced features. The real-time price integration was essential for accurate order calculations, though it added complexity to form state management.

## üìä **Positions Tab**

### Purpose
Comprehensive view of active positions with real-time P&L tracking and position management.

### Key Components
- **Active Positions Table**: Live position tracking with current values
- **Summary Stats**: Market value, unrealized P&L, and total return
- **Position Actions**: Close position functionality with confirmation modals
- **Real-time Updates**: Live P&L calculations using WebSocket price data

### Design Decisions
- **Table Layout**: Responsive table with horizontal scroll on mobile
- **Live P&L Components**: Direct DOM manipulation for smooth updates
- **Color Coding**: Consistent profit/loss color scheme (green/red)
- **Confirmation Modals**: Custom modals instead of browser alerts for better UX

### Trade-offs
- **Real-time vs Performance**: Live updates require more CPU but provide better user experience
- **Table vs Cards**: Tables on desktop, considering card layout for mobile in future iterations
- **Immediate vs Batch Updates**: Chose immediate updates for better responsiveness

### Reflection
The positions tab balances information density with readability. The live P&L calculations were technically challenging but crucial for a professional trading experience.

## üìã **History Tab**

### Purpose
Complete transaction history with filtering, sorting, and detailed P&L tracking.

### Key Components
- **Transaction Table**: Sortable, filterable transaction history
- **Summary Statistics**: Buy/sell order counts and total volume
- **Advanced Filtering**: Type-based filtering and search functionality
- **Live P&L Tracking**: Real-time P&L for buy orders based on current prices

### Design Decisions
- **Tabular Design**: Best for displaying structured transaction data
- **Smart Filtering**: Maintains filter controls even when no results match
- **Responsive Headers**: Icon-based headers with proper sort indicators
- **Live Current Values**: Real-time valuation for buy orders

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity vs Functionality**: Advanced filtering adds complexity but improves usability
- **Performance vs Features**: Full transaction history loading vs pagination (chose full loading for simplicity)
- **Mobile Layout**: Horizontal scroll vs stacked cards (chose scroll for data integrity)

### Reflection
The history tab required careful consideration of empty states and filter interactions. The bug fix ensuring filter controls remain visible was crucial for user experience.

## üìà **Analytics Tab**

### Purpose
Portfolio performance analysis and trading statistics with visual charts.

### Key Components
- **Portfolio Performance**: Live portfolio metrics with responsive cards
- **Trading Statistics**: Win rate, best/worst trades, profit factors
- **Performance Chart**: Real-time candlestick charts with multiple timeframes
- **Interactive Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts integration

### Design Decisions
- **Two-section Layout**: Performance metrics above, charts below
- **Live Data Integration**: Real-time portfolio calculations
- **Chart Library Choice**: TradingView Lightweight Charts for professional appearance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

### Trade-offs
- **Chart Library vs Custom**: TradingView provides professional features but adds bundle size
- **Real-time vs Static**: Live chart updates increase complexity but provide better experience
- **Mobile Charts**: Reduced height on mobile for better scrolling experience

### Reflection
The analytics tab showcases the platform's data visualization capabilities. The integration of live data with professional charting tools creates a compelling user experience, though it required careful performance optimization.
